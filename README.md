# Russian-Keyboard-Trainer
Training tool for the Russian keyboard on Windows.

Written in Python, this tool allows the user to learn how to type the various cyrillic letters using an English keyboard.  I used the default Russian keyboard provided by Windows, so dialectic variants for countries like Belarus may alter the layout.

The tool has two modes.  Mode 1 provides the Cyrillic character and asks you to type the corresponding English keyboard character.  Mode 2, on the other hand, provides the Cyrillic character and asks you to provide it back (using the Russian keyboard mode).  Entering 0 at any point will cause the program to exit.
